### mark1 Assignment | Let's Play K-Pop Band Quiz - A CLI App

**Path in the repo** - _mark1-assignment/kpop-band-cli-quiz-app_

In this assignment I've created a CLI App which consists of 6 quiz questions.
* It takes user name as input & then starts the quiz.
* It displays the user's current score.
* It displays the selected answer & whether it's correct or not.
* It also displays the highest score at the end.
Used CHALK library to give beautiful & colorful CLI experience.
